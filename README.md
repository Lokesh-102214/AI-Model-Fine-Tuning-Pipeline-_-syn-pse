# Project Title
A brief and catchy title for your project.

## Project Overview
This project leverages deep learning and NLP techniques for [describe the purpose, e.g., text classification, summarization, or model fine-tuning]. It utilizes Hugging Face models and optimization techniques to enhance performance.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **PyTorch** - Deep learning framework
- **Hugging Face Transformers** - Pre-trained NLP models
- **Optuna** - Hyperparameter optimization
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **Hugging Face Datasets** - Dataset loading and processing
- **Ipywidgets & IPython** - Interactive Jupyter notebook utilities

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
1. Rent an **RTX 6000 ADA** from **Spheron**.
2. Access the Jupyter Notebook environment provided by Spheron.

### Installation
1. Upload the `.ipynb` file to the Jupyter Notebook on Spheron.

## How to Use
1. Open the uploaded Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the model fine-tuning pipeline.
3. Modify hyperparameters and configurations as needed to experiment with different setups.
